Well they say people come
say people go
This particular diamond was extra special
And though you might be gone
and the world may not know
Still I see you celestia
Like a lion you ran
a goddess you rolled
Like an eagle you circle in perfect purple
So how come cars don't slow?
When it feels like the end of my world?
When I should but can't let you go?

But when I'm cold cold
When I'm cold cold
There's a light that you give me
when I'm in shadow
There's a feeling you give me, everglow

Like brothers in blood sisters who ride
And we swore on that night
we'd ve friends 'til we die
But the changing of winds
and the way waters flow
Life is short as the falling of snow
And now I am gonna miss you I know

But when I'm cold cold
In water rolled salt
And I know that you're with me
and the way you will show
And you're with me where I go
And you give me this feeling this everglow

Oh what I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold
Yeah I live for this feeling this everglow
So if you love someone
you should let them know
Oh the light that you left me
will everglow
